/**
 * Styles for managing the popover animations. These were generated by
 * Aphrodite's autoprefixer, but some minor tweaks were applied to get them
 * working on mobile Safari. Ideally, we'd be generating these styles with
 * Aphrodite (along with ReactCSSTransitionGroup's support for custom
 * classnames), but the generated styles have issues on mobile Safari.
 *   See: https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite/issues/68.
 *
 * If the animation durations change, the corresponding values in
 * popover-manager.js must change as well.
